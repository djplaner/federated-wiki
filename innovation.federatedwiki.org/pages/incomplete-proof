The old joke of the difference between a mathematician and a sociologist being that the former only needs paper, pencil, and a waste-paper basket, while the latter does not have a need for the waste-paper basket, comes to mind.

If von Neumann's maid would have salvaged all that material, I am sure that we would have found lots of treasures there. Marvin Knopp told me that the late Emil Grosswald had a file-cabinet labelled `failed attempts', that unfortunately is lost for ever. I am sure that many great (and lesser) minds had brilliant ideas on how to prove the Riemann Hypothesis, but just because they could not complete it themselves, they never published them, and we are doomed to never see them. Perhaps all they needed was a little help from Shalosh?, or from Andrew Wiles? Why did Paul Cohen stop publishing at the age of 30? my guess is that he was trying, and probably still is, to prove RH. I would love to be able to see his `failed attempts'. I am sure that Louis de Branges's many `wrong' proofs of RH and other conjectures are as chuck-full of brilliant ideas as is his proof of Bieberbach. But I will never get to see most of them. (Luckily, de Branges managed to publish some of his incomplete proofs, but I do not have the patience or background to go through them.)\n\nSo here is my revolutionary proposal. Publish all your (good) thoughts and ideas, regardless of whether they are finished or not. Of course, if you only need one more lemma to complete the proof of RH, you are welcome to wait a few months until you succeed, but if you still can't prove it, in, say, two years, PLEASE, publish it anyway. I promise you that I will still give you most of the credit for proving RH, and phrase my abstract as follows: `We prove a technical lemma needed in Joe Doe's brilliant proof of the Riemann Hypothesis', rather than: `We prove the RH, by proving a statement that was shown by Joe Doe to be equivalent to it'."
