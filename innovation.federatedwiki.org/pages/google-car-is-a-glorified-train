But if the car’s software determines that the environment in 34\nwhich it is operating differs from the key static features of its pre-specified map (e.g., an \nunexpected detour, a police officer directing traffic where a traffic signal is supposed to be), \nthen the car signals for its human operator to take command. Thus, while the Google car \nappears outwardly to be as adaptive and flexible as a human driver, it is in reality more akin to \na train running on invisible tracks."
