The way we like things is we make copies of them...\". This was not intuitive for me, but is making more sense as I traverse our pages (knowledge networks)."

I may Like someone’s comment because it’s witty or well written, even if it doesn’t have significance for my research or anything that I’m thinking about.  The Like is for them.  Forking, at least the way I look at it, is for me.  I fork someone’s writing because I have something to add to it, or I want to link it to past/future posts, or I want to save it to read again later.  The Like is probably unnecessary from a practical standpoint, but I feel like the gamification that it provides could make the experience “stickier” for students and new users while they slog up the initial learning curve."

I may Like someone’s comment because it’s witty or well written, even if it doesn’t have significance for my research or anything that I’m thinking about.  The Like is for them.  Forking, at least the way I look at it, is for me.  I fork someone’s writing because I have something to add to it, or I want to link it to past/future posts, or I want to save it to read again later.  The Like is probably unnecessary from a practical standpoint, but I feel like the gamification that it provides could make the experience “stickier” for students and new users while they slog up the initial learning curve."
