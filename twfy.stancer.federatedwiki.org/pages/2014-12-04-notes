This makes it obvious that the page that's \"missing\", in the sense that it doesn't really do anything atm, is the overarching page for an Issue generally (i.e. not one MP's stance on it). This used to list party stances with link to the Party page to explore further, but now that there is no Party page, this leaves this very bare. We do have a brief description of what this should be in the work notes, but I'm leaving it stark for now as a reminder that we need to flesh that out more. (In particular, if we're going to simply show data for the 'main parties', we'll need to make sure that's not just England-centric)."
