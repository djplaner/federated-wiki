        "text": "During the movie's traumatic live shark filming in South Australia, in which a very young Spielberg discovered that sharks aren't trainable \"like dolphins\", a near-catastrophe occurred. As the crew were preparing the shark cage for the Richard Dreyfuss stand-in (a professional jockey, chosen for his small size to make the available sharks look bigger), the only substantial shark ever to show up appeared and violently attacked the cage. Because all the fake shark underwater footage required the shark never to be viewed from snout to tail, mechanical operation being what it is, this footage of an actual white pointer actually violently attacking something was a triumph. But the cage was empty. So, the story goes, the plot was changed to explain that Hooper had already escaped the cage. "
