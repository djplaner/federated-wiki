Nothing about is and ever should be the same.</p>\n<p>Second, the notion of the automagic reshuffle challenges me.  Sounds an awful lot like some of the AI/Learning Analytics algorithmic solutions. *shudder* Which goes against the point about learners as automatons, so I know that's not what you meant.</p>\n<p>Lastly, not sure how all this adds up to \"effective action\", what that might mean, and what it might look like</p>"
